# Welcome to LangTrans

LangTrans customizes any programming language. You can make your own syntax for any programming language.

## How it works?

LangTrans converts your syntax into the original syntax.&#x20;

Regular expressions extract tokens from your language. You should make a template of the original language syntax.&#x20;

LangTrans takes both as input and converts code written in the new syntax to the original syntax.
