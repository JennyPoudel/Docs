# Welcome to LangTrans

LangTrans is used to customize any programming language. You can make your own syntax for any programming languages.

## How it works?

LangTrans converts your syntax into original syntax.&#x20;

Regular expressions are used to extract tokens from your language. You should write a template of the syntax of the original language.&#x20;

LangTrans take both as input and converts code written in new syntax to original syntax.
